1) Set HEAD of Git repository to commits under analysis 

	 commit_newer: cbf991276abba1b8f29bd2d4fa0ee90a793dd641
	 commit_older: cb5ad4528783f71bda41ed82c16ba25343c46912


2) Generate git diff log between files in newer commit against older commit 

	 len(diff_data_head_to_commit): 56


3) Based on git diff log create a lists of modified files or added files 

	 len(list_of_modified_files_to_be_processed): 3
	 len(list_of_added_files_to_be_processed): 0


4) Parse git diff log to separate file blocks (method body) for methods with added lines 

	 len(resulted_array_of_added_lines_in_changed_file_blocks): 3


5) Parse git diff log to separate file blocks (method body) for methods with removed lines 

	 len(resulted_array_of_removed_lines_in_changed_file_blocks): 3


6) Parse git diff log to separate file blocks (method body) for methods that have been added 

	 len(resulted_array_of_added_lines_in_added_file_blocks): 0


7) Parse file blocks (method body) for methods with added lines to separate names of the methods, as an output the normalized path to the file that contains the methods is also returned 

	 normalized path of file and its methods with added lines:[['src', 'main', 'java', 'tcpClient', 'ClientManager.java'], 'public ClientManager()', 'public void sendMessage()']
	 normalized path of file and its methods with added lines:[['src', 'main', 'java', 'tcpClient', 'TCPclient.java'], 'public TCPclient()']
	 normalized path of file and its methods with added lines:[['src', 'main', 'java', 'tcpServer', 'ComputeEngine_Runnable.java'], 'public ComputeEngine_Runnable()', 'private void sendMessage()']


8) Parse file blocks (method body) for methods with removed lines to separate names of the methods, as an output the normalized path to the file that contains the methods is also returned 

	 normalized path of file and its methods with removed lines: [['src', 'main', 'java', 'tcpClient', 'ClientManager.java'], 'public void sendMessage()']
	 normalized path of file and its methods with removed lines: [['src', 'main', 'java', 'tcpClient', 'TCPclient.java'], 'public TCPclient()']
	 normalized path of file and its methods with removed lines: [['src', 'main', 'java', 'tcpServer', 'ComputeEngine_Runnable.java'], 'public ComputeEngine_Runnable()', 'private void sendMessage()']


9) Parse file blocks (method body) for methods that have been added to separate names of the methods, as an output the normalized path to the file that contains the methods is also returned 



10) Concatenate the results from points 7., 8. and 9. (i.e. build single list of all methods that have been affected with normalized path to the file that contains the methods) 

	 normalized path of file and its aggregated affected methods: [['src', 'main', 'java', 'tcpClient', 'ClientManager.java'], 'public ClientManager()', 'public void sendMessage()']
	 normalized path of file and its aggregated affected methods: [['src', 'main', 'java', 'tcpClient', 'TCPclient.java'], 'public TCPclient()']
	 normalized path of file and its aggregated affected methods: [['src', 'main', 'java', 'tcpServer', 'ComputeEngine_Runnable.java'], 'public ComputeEngine_Runnable()', 'private void sendMessage()']


11) Create list of the methods affected by changes in newer commit against older commit 

	 affected method: ClientManager()
	 affected method: sendMessage()
	 affected method: TCPclient()
	 affected method: ComputeEngine_Runnable()
	 affected method: sendMessage()


12) Create list of the methods that call the methods affected by changes in newer commit against older commit 

	 method that calls affected internal method: messagesHandler()
	 method that calls affected internal method: initClient()
	 method that calls affected internal method: run()


13) Based on the lists of methods from points 11. and 12., create a list of unit tests that are optimal test suite for changes in newer commit against older commit (the list of tests is returned in format readable by pom.xml) 

	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpClient/ClientManagerTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpClient/SendMessageTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpClient/TCPclientTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/ComputeEngine_RunnableTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/SendMessageTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpClient/MessagesHandlerTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpClient/MessagesHandler_ServerMessage_ACKTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpClient/MessagesHandler_ServerMessage_Request_MeasurementDataTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpClient/MessagesHandler_ServerMessage_Request_MeasurementHistoryTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpClient/MessagesHandler_ServerMessage_SensorInfoQuerryTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpClient/MessagesHandler_ServerMessage_SensorInfoUpdateTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/RunTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/Run_ClientMessage_ACKTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/Run_ClientMessage_BootUpTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/Run_ClientMessage_MeasurementDataTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/Run_ClientMessage_MeasurementHistoryTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/Run_ClientMessage_SensorInfoTest.java</include>


14) Update pom.xml file with names of unit test to be executed

	 updated pom.xml with optimal test suite is saved in: C:\Projects\Test_Integration_Jenkins\CI_tool\master\JavaWorkspace_MT\UnitUnderTest\updated_pom.xml
