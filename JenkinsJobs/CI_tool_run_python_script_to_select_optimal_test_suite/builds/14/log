1) Set HEAD of Git repository to commits under analysis: 

	 commit_newer: 89b5a44c4a4e53e785565f5a765d31154baa41f0
	 commit_older: 908e1cde20be4afa5176972d3f44090047cf7b4f


2) Generate git diff log between files in newer commit against older commit: 

	 len(diff_data_head_to_commit): 17


3) Based on git diff log create a lists of modified files or added files: 

	 len(list_of_modified_files_to_be_processed): 1
	 len(list_of_added_files_to_be_processed): 0


4) Parse git diff log to separate file blocks (method body) for all changes (added/removed lines or added files): 

	 len(resulted_array_of_all_changes_in_file_blocks): 1


5) Parse git diff log to separate file blocks (method body) for methods with added lines: 

	 len(resulted_array_of_added_lines_in_changed_file_blocks): 1


6) Parse git diff log to separate file blocks (method body) for methods with removed lines: 

	 len(resulted_array_of_removed_lines_in_changed_file_blocks): 1


7) Parse git diff log to separate file blocks (method body) for methods that have been added: 

	 len(resulted_array_of_added_lines_in_added_file_blocks): 0


8) Parse file blocks (method body) for methods with added lines to separate names of the methods,
   as an output the normalized path to the file that contains the methods is also returned: 

	 [['src', 'main', 'java', 'tcpServer', 'ComputeEngine_Runnable.java'], 'private double _1h_Watchdog_close_to_expire()']


9) Parse file blocks (method body) for methods with removed lines to separate names of the methods,
   as an output the normalized path to the file that contains the methods is also returned: 

	 [['src', 'main', 'java', 'tcpServer', 'ComputeEngine_Runnable.java'], 'private double _1h_Watchdog_close_to_expire()']


10) Parse file blocks (method body) for methods that have been added to separate names of the methods,
    as an output the normalized path to the file that contains the methods is also returned: 



11) Concatenate the results from points 8., 9. and 10. (i.e. build single list of all methods that have been affected
    with normalized path to the file that contains the methods): 

	 [['src', 'main', 'java', 'tcpServer', 'ComputeEngine_Runnable.java'], 'private double _1h_Watchdog_close_to_expire()']


12) Create list of the methods affected by changes in newer commit against older commit: 

	 affected method: _1h_Watchdog_close_to_expire()


13) Create lists of the methods that call the methods affected by changes in newer commit against older commit: 

	package: tcpServer,	method name: run()


14) Based on the lists of methods from points 12. and 13., create a list of unit tests that are
    an optimal test suite for changes in newer commit against older commit (the list of tests is returned in format readable by pom.xml): 

	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/_1h_Watchdog_close_to_expireTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/RunTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/Run_ClientMessage_ACKTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/Run_ClientMessage_BootUpTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/Run_ClientMessage_MeasurementDataTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/Run_ClientMessage_MeasurementHistoryTest.java</include>
	 unit test to be executed: <include>**/tcpServer/Run_ClientMessage_SensorInfoTest.java</include>


15) Update pom.xml file with names of unit test to be executed:

	 updated pom.xml with optimal test suite is saved in: E:\Praca magisterska\CI_tool_source_code\JavaWorkspace_MT\UnitUnderTest\updated_pom.xml
